        <h3>Process:</h3>
               <ol>
                  <li>
                    1. Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    2. Heat the skillet over medium heat
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    3. Butter one side of each slice of bread
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    4. Place one slice of the buttered bread, buttered side down, into the skillet
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    5. Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover the entire surface area
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    6. Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    7. Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden brown)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    8. Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other side till golden brown (approximately 1 to 2 minutes)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    9. Eat with ketchup, or just enjoy the plain crispy goodness of your grilled cheese
                  </li>
                </ol>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.
